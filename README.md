# Printable Faceplates for Hammond Boxes

This project contains CAD models of blank faceplates for selected enclosure
boxes made by Hammond Manufacturing.

These are intended to be modified (adding cutouts) and 3d printed. The
cutouts may alternatively be machined into the original faceplates using
a hobby router. (The original faceplates are ABS, which responds poorly to
laser cutting.)

The following boxes are supported:

* 1455T1602 and compatible (HM904-ND on Digikey) (1455Txx02 series).
